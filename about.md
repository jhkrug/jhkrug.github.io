I used to work at [Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk) in
the [Library](http://lancaster.ac.uk/library) in the Digital Innovation
team where I did things with library systems and analytics. Since
March 2017, I work as an independent consultant in library systems and
analytics. I like bicycles and cycling, for transport, recreation,
fitness and sport ... a lot.
