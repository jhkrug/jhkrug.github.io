*Get them early*

Husband, dad, grandad, cyclist, migrant.

I used to work at [Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk)
in the [Library](http://lancaster.ac.uk/library) as part of the
Digital Innovation team where I did things with library systems and
analytics. Since April 2017, I work as a consultant in library systems
and analytics. I am also available to guide cycling related activities in the
Granada/Alpujarras/Sierra Nevada areas.

I'm interested in:

* library data, it's storage, retrieval, processing, protection and
analysis
* analytics and visualization
* library management systems
* Europe and being European
* cycling for sport, leisure and transport

There is more detail about consultancy work [here]({% post_url

and [here]({% post_url 2018-04-06-work_plan %}).

Wondering about the favicon? Probably not. Anyway it's a compression of this.

*No privatization*

A photo I took of a poster protesting the privatization of street lighting. I
think it was in Seville a few years ago.

Cycling

My road bike, a bit old but then so am I.
