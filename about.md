*Get them early*

Husband, dad, granddad, cyclist. 

I used to work at [Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk)
in the [Library](http://lancaster.ac.uk/library) as part of the
Digital Innovation team where I did things with library systems and
analytics. Since April 2017, I work as a consultant in
library systems and analytics.

I'm interested in:

* library data, it's storage, retrieval, processing, protection and analysis
* analytics and visualisation
* library management systems
* Europe and being European
* cycling for sport, leisure and transport
* sometimes other things
