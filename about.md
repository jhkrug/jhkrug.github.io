[![My long-lost sibling](/public/images/jhk.jpg "My long-lost sibling")](/public/images/jhk.jpg) _My long-lost sibling_

Since July 2023, I'm working at [SUSE](https://suse.com) in the technical
documentation team.

I used to work at [Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk) in the
[Library](http://lancaster.ac.uk/library) as part of the Digital Innovation
team where I did things with library systems and analytics.

I started up [libtics.org](https://libtics.netlify.app) based on a project with
the University of Leeds. It's still available, and is CC licensed, but not
currently active.

I'm interested in:

- technical writing and docs-as-code
- Cloud and Linux tech @SUSE
- library data, its storage, retrieval, processing, protection and analysis
- analytics and visualization
- cycling for sport, leisure, and transport

Contact me:

- email: [jh.krug@gmail.com](mailto:jh.krug@gmail.com)
- Phone: +34 644 334 591 - Use Signal (preferred) or Telegram.
  I never answer voice from numbers not in my contacts, get in
  touch via a text mechanism first.

Here is a brief [résumé](/public/john-krug-r.pdf).

Here are a couple of references from:

## Cycling

I like to ride, usually sloqly, trying to look around and enjoy the scenery.

My main bicycle is a lovely purple Soma Double Cross.

I also have a Brompton. Sometimes, I cycle it to inappropriate places for its
strengths.
