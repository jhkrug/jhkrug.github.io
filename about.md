[![My long-lost sibling](/public/images/jhk.jpg "Mylong-lost sibling")](/public/images/jhk.jpg) *My long-lost sibling*

I used to work at [Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk) in the
[Library](http://lancaster.ac.uk/library) as part of the Digital Innovation
team where I did things with library systems and analytics. From April 2017,
until June 2022, I occasionally worked as a consultant in library systems and
analytics.

I started up [libtics.org](https://libtics.org) based on a project with the
University of Leeds. It is still available, and is CC licensed, but not
currently being worked on.

Since 4 July 2022, I work as a technical writer at
[OutSystems](https://outsystems.com).

I'm interested in:

* library data, it's storage, retrieval, processing, protection and
analysis
* analytics and visualization
* library management systems
* cycling for sport, leisure and transport
* technical writing and docs-as-code
* Cool tech @ OutSystems

. I never answer voice from numbers not in my contacts so get in
touch via a text mechanism first.
