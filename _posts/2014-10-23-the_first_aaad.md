Well, what was it? Social get together, workshop,
[unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference), extended
chat, exchange of experience, inaugural SIG meeting? A bit of all that.
I've wrote up the day on the wiki we agreed to set-up. These are personal
reflections on the day.

We met at the British Library conference centre at Euston on Tuesday 14
October 2014, following the EPUG-UKI. I'd chosen the place and time for
proximity to that event on the assumption it would make it easy for people
to attend and hence more likely to. No, only four were there on the day
before of the 18 who were able to attend on the day. I don't think I'll
worry about that again although we did say at the end it would be good
to meet next on the day after the EPUG-UKI in April. It's the nature of
the UK transport economy that it's usually easier for everybody to get
to Euston, London than it is, for example, to get from York to Lancaster.

I had never organised anything remotely similar before so it was extremely
useful to have a room at the British Library, with badges and catering
arranged by Andrea Stubbs. I used Eventbrite to manage registration and
SurveyMonkey to collect some feedback.

I was up early on the day and nervously waiting from 8:30 for people
to turn up, which they duly did with only a couple unable to make
it. Seventeen people including myself where there. This seemed to indicate
a reasonable interest in establishing an Alma Analytics UKI SIG.

I had deliberately not created an agenda, just suggested a list of topics
we might wish to discuss. We began with  some extended introductions in
an attempt that people would get to know each other, have some idea how
others were working and hoped to be working with Analytics.

We spend some time discussing SCONUL reporting, the perceived
documentation problems, issues with requests and usage reporting.
I think it's fair to say that Lancaster, Sheffield and York are a few
months further on with reporting than other institutions which, in some
cases, have only had Alma for a few weeks. 

After lunch I was feeling that the three of us had been dominating
discussions so I proposed that we try some ad-hoc report construction
tutorials. Edinburgh Napier people suggested a couple of reports and we
showed how to go about constructing the desired report in Analytics. This
demonstrated the user interface and the use of filters and was effective
in giving a feel of working with Analytics

The feedback received from 14 attendees indicates that 100% thought the
day was worthwhile and 100% would come to another one. The next meeting
will probably have a little more of a structured agenda, but I want to
maintain some form of participant control of content on the day. I think
it's quite likely the next meeting will be have more participants. I
think there will be scope for splitting into groups for participant
driven tutorials or mini 'hackathons', topics decided on interest and
level of experience. The feedback indicated demand for more of this type
of activity.

We decided we would try to have the next meeting following the EPUG-UKI
AGM in April 2015, probably in London again. We would endeavour to have
it in a computer lab or with as many laptops as possible at the BL.

We finished about 4 o'clock. I got back home to Lancaster at about 8. A
tiring day for me.
