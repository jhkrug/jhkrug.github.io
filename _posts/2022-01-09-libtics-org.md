It's been a quiet few months at [libtics.org](https://libtics.org) with the
main item of note being the construction of vagrant and docker development
environments for people who want to share in the analytics content development.
More below .....

But, I think I can say that libtics.org is now fully live.

I've been trying to clarify pricing, and ....., it's all Creative Commons
licensed, but voluntary contributions gratefully received. Also, trying to
think about the the future viability of the project, being an independent
person outside Ex Libris, HE institutions and by extension the IgeLU and ELUNA
communities.

A reminder that libtics.org, the Ex Libris Analytics section/chapter, covers
the following topics.

The material covers:

* Introduction
* Using analytics in practice
* Understanding your data
* In more depth
* Dashboards
* Reusing components
* Format, style, charting
* Primo analytics
* Oracle Data Visualization -- the new analytics component since October 2020.

Next up will be:

* Some Leganto (hopefully building on from some consultancy work in this area)
* Extraction/Export/APIs
* More examples, especially to do with e-resources and workflow
* In greater depth on a number of topics.

You can take a look at [libtics.org](https://libtics.org).
