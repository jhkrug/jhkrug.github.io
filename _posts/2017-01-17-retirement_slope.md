It's time to begin semi-retirement. On 31<sup>st</sup> January I leave
the Digital Innovation team at Lancaster University Library, my place
of work for almost 15 years. I'll miss my colleagues, I hope some will
miss me.

It'll be a long process as I'm not 'retiring' but changing how and
where I work and maybe doing less of it. But, retirement is the
direction.

My partner and I are moving to Andaluc√≠a, near Granada, in February.
We have, for a long time, intended to retire early there. Sue feels
much healthier in the sun and warmth and I'm not complaining about
cycling in it. The cost of living is more conducive to making our
pension last. The time has come a year sooner than we were
anticipating or wanted. Brexit, ***ffs*** &#x1f631;. We are going to
try get officially established in our future home before/in case
negotiations start requiring the exchange of sacrificial pawns,
Europeans wanting to live outside their country of birth. We can only
be optimistic that won't happen and that we can continue to be
European citizens.

By April, 2017 we'll have started settling in there, and I'll be
available for consultancy work. Given the ubiquity of cloud and
communications tools, remote working is more than feasible for those
parties innovative enough to embrace it. I can travel if an assignment
demands it. Much of my recent work has used these sorts of tools and
involved travel so this model of working is not strange to me. I have
a long history in library management systems from Ex Libris, Aleph and
Alma, and a particular interest in data, reporting and analytics.

What would I like to be involved with?
--------------------------------------

A non-exclusive list, maybe to include working on something open
source, maybe something else ...

* Being a mentor. Is there an early career systems librarian or two
who would like a mentor? I've never tried this before, it's an
experiment and we'll be learning from each other. Maybe it won't work
out. The emphasis will be on the career and systems side as I'm not a
qualified librarian. Of course, I won't charge for this.

* Alma and Aleph Library Analytics training and projects. Do you need
some reporting/analytics doing? Perhaps you don't have the skills
locally at your institution yet? I can do the work and maintain the
result. Much better, I can provide customised training, workshops and
support to help you get to the position you want to be in for the
future. This might be particularly relevant to new Alma customers. I
can help with anything from basic reporting, dashboards and data
extraction via APIs right through to integrating analytics into your
workflows.

* General library data wrangling. If it needs ....

	* extracting
	* processing
	* transforming
	* migrating
	* loading
	* exploring 
	* interpreting
	* visualising
	* presenting
	* securing

	I can probably help, whether a one-off task or integrating the
	processes into your workflow.

Experience and qualifications
-----------------------------

How am I qualified for this? I have no current CV, it's been a long time
since one has been necessary. But, briefly:

* MSc in Software Systems at Sheffield, way back when things like
[4GLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language)
and
[SSADM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_systems_analysis_and_design_method)
were things.

* 3 years research in parallel image processing at the
[NTSC](http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/inf/transputers/p002.htm). 
Anyone remember [CSP, the Transputer and
Occam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam_(programming_language))?

* 1 year at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in the City of London (sorry)
working on FX derivative systems. I was there on '[Black
Wednesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday)', when the
pound was forced out of the ERM. It wasn't my fault.

* 9 years IT infrastructure consultancy in retail ([IBM Professional
Services](http:www.ibm.com) working for [ASDA](http://www.asda.com/)),
utilities ([North West Water](http://www.unitedutilities.com/), as
was) and the city, the [FSA](http://www.fsa.gov.uk/) this time. The
last six years being one of the directors of a consultancy company.
Though not an 'internet' company. We got taken out by the collapse of
the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble),
and internal company politics, in early 2002. There's a lesson about
[rising tides and
boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rising_tide_lifts_all_boats)
there, and the falling tide corollary.

* Fifteen wonderful years at Lancaster University Library. Mainly
infrastructure, programming, Unix/Linux, SQL, Aleph and Alma, their integration and
reporting/analytics, some Primo and lots of other bits, pieces and
projects. Some recent things of note:

	* Being an early adopter for Alma, the third institution, I
	believe, to go live in the world.

	* As it's first coordinator and with the help of the rest of
	the volunteers I got the
	[IGeLU](http://igelu.org/)/[ELUNA](http://el-una.org/)
	Analytics SIWG started.

	* Committee member with the
	[EPUG-UKI](http://www.epuguki.org/) user group.

	* Organised EPUG-UKI Analytics days in 2014 and 2015 for
	presentations, workshops and sharing experience.

	* Developing a prototype backend for a RDM analytics/reporting
	system, funded by JISC.

	* Managing to end up with a great manager. Thanks
