After getting back from holiday on 21<sup>st</sup> September some mild
panic ensued. The second AAD (Alma Analytics Day) under the auspices of
[EPUG-UKI](http://www.epuguki.org/) was due in 12 working days, with two
of those being the actual EPUG-UKI AGM and another day in York. Nothing
had taken place beforehand due to heavy involvement in a JISC [Research
data spring](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/research-data-spring)
project called [DMAOnline](http://dmao.info) and attendance at the
[IGeLU15](http://igelu.org/conferences/2015-budapest) conference.

It was time to get moving. An event had been setup on Eventbrite from
18 August so I knew plenty of people were going to be attending. We had
been hoping to use a room at the British Library, the same venue as for
the EPUG-UKI AGM but it turned out to not be possible so Andrea Stubbs
at the BL arranged for us to use BMA House in Tavistock Square as a
venue. That was confirmed on 18<sup>th</sup> August.

All that involved a lot of to-ing and fro-ing. So having a definite venue
and knowing we were definitely going to be able to go ahead it was time
to get some content arranged. However, being involved in DMAOnline and
the new JISC competitive process and IGeLU15 meant I didn't get started
until after leave on 21<sup>st</sup> September. That was the big mistake,
assuming I needed a venue before organising the structure and content
of the day, and then leaving the organisation till so late.

What I had in mind was a number of joint session 'lightning talks'
and parallel session workshops. Contributions for the 'lightning talks'
were needed and presenters/leaders for the workshop sessions. I composed
an email asking for contributions and volunteers and sent it to the
attendees on 24<sup>th</sup> September. While people were thinking
about what they could do there were no replies within a day or two which
considering everybody was getting ready for the new academic year was, in
retrospect, hardly surprising. Just because my role is largely free of the
constraints of the academic year these days does not mean that everybody
else would be able to devote much time to the rapidly coming AAD15.

A few people volunteered lightning talks and workshop sessions and I
got on the phone a few times using gentle persuasion to flesh out the
programme.

On the 5<sup>th</sup> October it was down to London for two days of
the EPUG-UKI AGM. Amin Hussain from the University of Manchester and I
were voted onto the committee to add some Alma and Analytics impetus
so I'm looking forward to being involved with the work that EPUG-UKI
does. Which I'm hoping is going to involve more Analytics and Developer
days as that's my interest

On the 7<sup>th</sup> I headed over to BMA House. Our event was taking
place in the Prince's Room, a large circular two storey high room in the
centre of the building. It looked fabulous. Acoustics were bad though
but things improved after bringing in a microphone. Unfortunately we
could not get another room for the parallel sessions which caused a bit
of a problem with noise interference between the two groups.

Alan Oliver from Ex Libris started things off with a brief presentation
about the big news from the day before, the proposed acquisition of
Ex Libris by Proquest. With that out of the way it was onto Analytics
with a couple of lightning talks. There were supposed to be 43 people
attending of which for a variety of reasons only 38 actually made
it. Which I think is a pretty good turnout.

In the end the day turned out mostly fine. Very tiring, for me personally,
having hosted 3 of the workshop sessions. It's great to be involved in
building a bit of a community, sharing experiences, meeting new people
and networking. The initial survey response show that the day was well
received, perceived to be valuable and most would attend again and
recommend similar events to colleagues.

### Lessons

1. Time keeping is difficult when distracted by providing
content. Sorry. Could do with a better conference chair possibly with
a rod of iron for ruling. It also meant I wasn't paying much attention to
the talks as I was busy juggling stuff in my head which was unfortunate.

1. We need a machine set up for any presentations and demos and have the
presentations ready to go. We spent too much time messing with laptops
and cables. The machine needs a mouse for those, like me, who find mouse
pads challenging.

1. We need as many rooms as we have parallel sessions, each room should
have a projector or ideally a high resolution big telly. Lot's of people
have Mac's and iPads so something with an Apple TV for sharing the screen
by Bluetooth would be great for the workshop sessions. If anybody knows
of something that works with PC's as well please let me know. Microphones
are necessary as soon as you get more that a small number of people in
a room. Many people are naturally quiet.

1. More comprehensive agenda, available well in advance, like a proper
conference. So people can choose sessions well in advance. Ideally if
presenters know the audience capabilities and skills some customisation
can be done. This can be done in registration with Eventbrite with some
appropriate questions.

1. Catering, double and triple check the requirements and communications
between ourselves and the venue for this. I heard some vegans missed
out on lunch, for which I can only apologise and make sure it doesn't
happen next time.

1. Many were new starters with Analytics and had come to learn. So the
Analytics 101 session should be the first item of the day.

1. Need a few more pictures of the day for these sort of posts.

1. Use a hashtag not shared with the 2015 American Academy of Dermatology
conference.

Many thanks to all who attended and presented, making the day successful
and in particular to Andrea Stubbs for helping with the organisation.

Now, for the next one!
