Now that we have settled into life in our new home over the past
year I'd like to continue doing some work in the realm of HE library
analytics. The simplest mechanism would be to just take work when it's
available and bill for time and expenses as necessary. It's just that
it's neither practical or legal to do that. Please read on.

<!--more-->

My rates are €60 per hour or €480 per day (excluding Spanish IVA
or VAT at 21%) plus any travel and accommodation expenses. That's
competitive compared to the costs of consultancy from library vendors.
Travel and accommodation can be kept to a minimum in the online modern
world and needless to say, I'll be going economy.

It's worth noting that I'm keen on project work, skills transfer and
building capability at your institutions rather than just carving out a
niche doing analytics reports for you. But I can do that as well if it's
what's currently needed. &#x1f642;

Also bear in mind, I'm a systems person, not a librarian by training so
in order to get the most from my services input from your local workflow
specialists is going to be needed in most cases.

To work as an independent sole trader in Spain I need to register as
an '**autónomo**'. This allows me to pay taxes and social security,
including health insurance. The taxes are paid as income is generated.
The social security part is not and is a fixed monthly cost. It's not
practical (limited semi-retirement budget) for me to pay the fixed costs
hoping work will be generated in the future.

Given I have to work as an 'autónomo', to make this financially
sustainable I need to have a commitment from **two** institutions to do
work for **two** days a month **each**. Or **four** institutions for
**one** day a month **each**. Or even **one** institution to employ
me for **four** days. Ideally though it needs to be at least two
institutions, to spread the risk, and must be at least four days a month
to make it viable. I'm sure you get the idea.

I'd imagine this sort of work would probably be project based, maybe
improving existing reporting, skills transfer and development, etc.

Of course, I'm also happy to work on one or multi day workshops and
training sessions, at your location, based around your specific needs.
It would be the standard rate for the day(s) plus preparation time
and expenses in agreement with you. But, still, I need the regular
engagement to make it all viable.

So, what can I do for your institution. The situation has
not changed that much in the past year, so please take a
look at my [post]({% post_url 2017-01-17-retirement_slope
%}#what-would-i-like-to-be-involved-with) from a year ago.

It's worth noting that OBIEE skills for Alma Analytics are readily
transferable to doing Primo and Leganto analytics.

One change to note; I'd love to do some work on EBSCO Folio if anybody
is interested. I've had conversations with a couple of people at EBSCO,
but sadly nothing has come of it yet.

And one more; I have some ideas that have emerged while preparing for
the EPUG-UKI Analytics workshop at the British Library in April.
Who would be interested in a hosted service that provided the reports
difficult to do in Alma Analytics, especially those combining subject
areas in ways not envisioned by Ex Libris?

So, speak to each other, speak to managers, get in touch and lets see
what can be arranged.

Thanks!
