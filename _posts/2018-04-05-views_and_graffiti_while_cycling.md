For no particular reason[^1] I thought I'd share the views and
graffiti I've seen while out cycling, enjoying semi-retirement, near
Padul and Durcal. If you've been to Spain you'll know there is plenty
of graffiti on various themes to go along with the usual tagging and
knob and balls. No doubt I'm misinterpreting some language.

[^1]:Other than reacquainting myself with git, markdown, GitHub Pages and jekyll.

On the outskirts of Durcal is Puente de Lata, The Tin Bridge.  Apparently,
imported from France when it proved to be too weak for traffic and trams. It's
for pedestrians and cyclists and spans Durcal Gorge. There has been at least one
suicide. Also, other mishaps. If you like the thrill, you can try bungee-jumping
there. On the bridge approach pillars is the graffiti 'si tu saltas yo salto'.
Poignantly, 'if you jump I fall', or maybe, 'if you jump I jump'.
