Fancy doing some cycling in Spain, around the Sierra Nevada, Valle de
Lecrín or La Alpujarra? Yeah, thought so. Join me on my photo[^1]
tour ride this morning. I do this loop frequently. It's straight
out the door, about 40km with 750m elevation gain and takes around two
hours. And it's stunning.

[^1]:Some, but not all the photographs were taken during this ride.

You can see the ride on
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/2503122223). Images and

I started riding about quarter to eight, it was quite cloudy and
slightly cooler than it has been recently, about 18°C. I live in
the older part of Padul which is quite high so roll down to the main
street and over onto Los Molinos the camino going out into the campo,
an area of large allotments or smallholdings. This is flat for a
few km, providing an opportunity to warm up. The road goes past an
archaeological site where ancient cart tracks are eroded into the rock.
It's one of only a few sites in Europe where such tracks exist. There
are good views south east, across the Laguna and olive groves, to the
Sierra Nevada and the peak of Caballo (snow capped during the winter) at
3011m. The sound of cicadas through the olive and almond groves can be
startlingly loud at this time of year.

Leave the campo via a bumpy concrete track to join the GR-3208 to
Albuñuelas passing a disused water viaduct on the right and a bodega
and vineyard on the left.

Past the turn to Conchar the climbing starts. On
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/segments/11838665), it's 4.9km at an
average grade of about 4%. A nice lung opener. There is a quarry on the
left and a couple of lorries going to and from. They leave plenty of
room as they pass with a roar and hot waft of exhaust fumes and quarry
dust.

After the top a [fast descent](https://www.strava.com/segments/12537902)
follows, wind roaring in your ears, with great views of the Lecrín
Valley to the left if you can take your eyes off the road for a second.

|[![Above the Lecrín Valley](/public/images/lecrin_panorama.jpg "Above the Lecrín Valley")](/public/images/lecrin_panorama.jpg) *Above the Lecrín Valley*|

Cross a bridge over the barranco and start
[climbing](https://www.strava.com/segments/1223569) again with a
vertical cliff above to the right and views into the Lecrín Valley on
the left. It's 2km at 6% up to the roundabout outside Albuñuelas. The
sun is properly up now and the roadside crash barriers are making their
peculiar pinging and creaking noises as they warm up and expand.

There has been a lot of road building and renewal in Spain over the past
30 years, there are ghosts of old roads poking out everywhere. I find
them fascinating and wonder how they were to ride.

Strangely (I've never seen one round here before), there is a large
frog/toad in the road. It seems a bit frozen, maybe it suffered a close
pass. Having experienced a few over the years, I sympathise, stop, take a
photo, shoo it into the gutter where it hopped off after a minute, and
carry on.

At the roundabout I pause for some water and pictures of the
[acequia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acequia) and orange trees. The
acequias are useful sources of water for splashing on your head when its
hot. Also, most villages have a public drinking water fountain.

From here the descent is fast, steep, a bit of care is needed, there
are some sharp bends. Take a little time to appreciate the Albuñuelas
gorge to the right. This descent takes you down to Saleres, one of
those iconic looking white mountain pueblos. Now cruise along the
valley into Restabal and take a look at the strange, enigmatic water
fountain/monument/shrine/garden/something before dropping a little
further to the Río Izbor and Río Torrente which feed Embalse de
Béznar.

Now the final [climb](https://www.strava.com/segments/7316506) starts,
it's 8.24km, averaging 4%. It's steady, wending it's way out of the
valley, through Melegís and orange and lemon groves and packing sheds,
past Chite, into Lecrín and Talara. There are excellent views over
and down the Lecrín Valley towards the reservoir, Embalse de Beznar.
Something to look at while you find your rhythm to cope with the heat
and gradient.

After Talara follow the Río Torrente valley road under the
motorway viaduct, over the bridge and topping out at the bottom of
the turn to Nigüelas. Then it's down to the double roundabout at
[Mercadona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercadona), take care, it can
be busy.

To finish off it's the N323 main road back to Padul. Slightly downhill
or flat(ish) so some speed can be gained if you want step on the
gas but keep an eye out for the Río Dúrcal gorge below (there
is a lovely waterfall much further up), spanned by the [Puente de
Lata](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puente_de_Lata) (Tin Bridge), and
the [Laguna](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna_de_El_Padul) wetlands
and peat bog on the left, outside Padul. Yes, peat bog .... in southern
Spain. This is main road but is designated as 'Tránsito Ciclista' so
the traffic is, very much, mostly considerate. It's the route used by
cyclists between Granada and the Alpujarras, buzzing with club pelotons
on Saturday and Sunday. Into Padul and the last steep bits back to the
house can be tough.

A very satisfying spin to start the day. If you would like to experience
this ride and many others here then get in touch. I'm available for
cycle guiding. I can help with accommodation or make suggestions.
Airport transfers for Granada, Malaga and Almeria may be possible. I
can provide a breakdown service (physical, mechanical, or mental, some
rides here are tough) to get you back. I can guide you through the
Alpujarras or ride with you up Pico Veleta, where you can cycle up to
just below the peak at 3396m. Maybe some mountain biking on sections
of the Trans-Nevada MTB trail. Padul is close to Granada if you fancy
some sightseeing at the Alhambra. Or some walking, I don't just cycle.
Together, we can plan and customise your adventure.
